# CircuitPython
My CircuitPython assignments are in this repository.

On Chromebook, I am using Caret for code and Beagle Term for a serial monitor. On PC, I will probbaly use Atom.io.

I am using a Metro Express to perfrom my code. The Metro Express is a handy Arduino-like-machine, but it runs Circuit Python instead of C++.

Here is my Engineering III box, containing the parts that my code apply to:
