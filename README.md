# CircuitPython
My CircuitPython assignments are in this repository.

#### Note - Metro Express only runs files named (main.py). If you want to use my code, awesome; just remember that Metro Express will not run it until it is changed to (main.py) and it is put inside of the CIRCUITPY removable USB.

#### If there is a CircuitPython library or command that is confusing or that you would like to explore, go to [CircuiPython Read The Docs.](https://readthedocs.org/projects/circuitpython/)

On Chromebook, I am using Caret for code and Beagle Term for a serial monitor. On PC, I will probbaly use Atom.io.

I am using a Metro Express to perform my code. The Metro Express is a handy Arduino-like-machine. It runs Circuit Python instead of C++.

Here is my Engineering III box, containing the parts that my code apply to:
