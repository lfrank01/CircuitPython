# Overview

For the Classes, Objects, and Modules assignment, libraries and classes were introduced. 

More information is coming soon.

# Lessons Learned 

* It is better not to use commas in naming, like for Classes, Objects, And Modules, because some programs may see commas as a reference to something or formatting change.

* Class names are capitalized, such as `class Dog`, but library names are not. An example of this would be `from dog import Dog`

* Classes include shared variables and methods. Methods distinguish seperate instances of a class. 

More information is coming soon.
