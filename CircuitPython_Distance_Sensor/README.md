# Overview
For the CircuitPython Distance Sensor assignment, I had to wire up and code a HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor to print the distance it read to the serial monitor. 

Only [one](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_HCSR04/blob/master/adafruit_hcsr04.py) file had to be added to the (.lib) folder of the CIRCUITPY removable USB!

# Lessons Learned
