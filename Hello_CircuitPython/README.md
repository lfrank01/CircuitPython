# Hello CircuitPython
## Overview

The Hello CircuitPython assignment explained how to set up CircuitPython with my Metro Express. At the end of it, I was able to run my first code!

The proccess of setting up CircuitPython varies for different devices:

* For a Cromebook, use Caret for code and Beagle Term for a serial monitor.
* For a Mac or PC, use Mu. Mu incorporates code editing and a serial monitor.
* Keep in mind that for CircuitPython code editing, any text editor can be used. The file that the code is edited on will likley need a .py at the end of it to signify that it is CircuitPython.

After downloading Caret and Beagle Term on the Google Play Store for Chromebook, here is how I proceeded:

* Plug in the Metro Express. It should apear as a removable file. 
* In Caret, select the upload file option and find the Metro Express
* The screen should look like this:

* Click on the main.py file. A .py file is CircuitPython.
* The file should have lots of text. If it is run, the Metro Express should perform something with the built in LED.
* Now that the text editor knows that it is editibg CircuitPython, the large amount of code can be deleted. When typing new code, there should be different colors and effects.
* 

Here is the link to my code, which is listed as a seperate file in this folder. Note that a # means that the code is a comment and will not run. Another tip: saving a file as a .py file will often add CircuitPython effects, at least for Atom.io.
