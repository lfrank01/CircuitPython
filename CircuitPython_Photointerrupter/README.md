# Overview
For the CircuitPython_Photointerrupter assignment, I had to wire up and code a photointerrupter to emmit the number of times it had been interrupted every four seconds. An LCD add on for displaying the number of interruptions was optional.
I had not worked with a photointerrupter yet, so it was a new expirience. More work is coming soon.
